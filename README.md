  HYGEIA: A reciprocal platform to help people pull through during the pandemic. This is a demo of 2020 Google Girl Hackathon VI project.
# Brief Introduction
  COVID-19 is challenging the medical system at every corner of the world. At this special moment, governments are calling on people to stay at home to prevent infection.
  Our ultimate goal is to make sure people at home get help in time. This help includes but is not limited to:
  1. Help the elderly get daily necessities.
  2. Feed the cat of oneâ€™s neighbor who was taken to hospital unprepared.
  3. Buy food and medicine for the self-quarantine family.
  4. Pick up packages or takeaways for friends at the same community...
  We design a platform showing these tasks required by all kinds of people, so
that people within the community can help each other. There're two main roles at the platform: The publishers who post these tasks according to their needs, the executors who are willing to do these tasks within a limit of time.
Credits system has been established to get people motivated. And we also design a privacy preserving policy and process tracking pipeline in case of data leakage and task failure happens.
  We hope that people stay at home safe and their lives keep less affected during the pandemic.
